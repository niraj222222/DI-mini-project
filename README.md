- Total sales and units sold  
- Top-performing cities and states  
- Most and least popular products

Different types of visualizations such as **line charts, maps, bar graphs,** and **funnel charts** are used to make the data easy to understand. The dashboard helps identify high-performing areas, products in demand, and opportunities for improvement. This enables **better decision-making**, **customer satisfaction**, and **business growth**.

## üõí Introduction

Amazon is one of the largest e-commerce platforms globally. In India, thousands of customers buy various products daily, generating massive amounts of sales data.

This project aims to analyze that data to gain insights like:

- Which cities and states have the highest orders  
- Which products are best-sellers  
- How overall sales are distributed geographically

The analysis was done using **Power BI**, a data visualization tool that turns raw data into interactive dashboards. These dashboards make it easier to extract insights, improve planning, optimize inventory, and enhance overall business performance.

## üîß Technique

The data analysis followed a structured workflow:

1. **Data Collection:** Extracted raw sales data across cities, states, and product categories  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Managed missing values and standardized formats  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified patterns and trends using statistical tools  
4. **Data Visualization:** Created visuals with Power BI and Matplotlib  
5. **Sales Mapping:** Used line charts and heatmaps for geographical performance  
6. **Product Analysis:** Bar and funnel charts showed category-wise sales distribution  
7. **KPI Dashboarding:** Highlighted total sales, units sold, and city/state coverage  
8. **Recommendations:** Suggested improvements based on insights

## üìê Amazon Sales Data ‚Äì Formulas Used

- **Total Sales** = Œ£ (Price √ó Quantity)  
- **Units Sold** = Total number of items sold  
- **Average Order Value (AOV)** = Total Sales / Number of Orders  
- **Sales Distribution %** = (Product Sales / Total Sales) √ó 100  
- **City Performance Index** = Sales per City / Number of Customers
